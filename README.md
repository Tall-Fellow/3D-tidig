# 3D-tidig
A re-imagination of an existing 2D website, re-created in 3D using the Three.js library (https://threejs.org). For animations the Tween.js library (https://github.com/tweenjs/tween.js) has been used and the navigation menu was created using Swiper.js (https://swiperjs.com). Created as part of a Bachelor Thesis at Luleå Tekniska Högskola (LTU).

## Setup
To setup a local development site you first need to setup a local development server, please refer to https://threejs.org/manual/#en/setup or https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/Installation for different options and how to setup your own local development server. Personally, I've used NPX serve (make sure you have node.js installed) through the command line interface (CLI) during the development.

Once you have your local dev server setup, simply download or clone this repository to get started. If you're using NPX serve through the CLI just navigate to the project folder (that holds all the project files) and use the command `npx serve`. Your site should now be accessable through localhost.

## Documentation & Resources
Three.js has excellent documentation, I'd recommend using the following resources:

The three.js manual for learning about Three.js: https://threejs.org/manual/<br>
The three.js documentation: https://threejs.org/docs/

For the other libraries I'd recommend the following resources (In the repository these are installed using the CDN method so they don't need to be installed locally):

Tween.js installation: https://github.com/tweenjs/tween.js/blob/main/README.md<br>
Tween.js user guide: https://github.com/tweenjs/tween.js/blob/main/docs/user_guide.md

Swiper.js installation: https://swiperjs.com/get-started<br>
